We used google DTA api to calculte the fare and distance of the trip ,All the user data will get store in firebase as it not only  provide the api keys for DTA  but  also it  have the store capacity for a large dataset.

The react Framework helps us for smooth user experience .It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page ,and by  this feature our map will keep fetching the user current location without reloading every minute.
